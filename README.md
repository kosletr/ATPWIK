# MERN ATPWIK (MERN Application To Present What I Know)

A Mongodb-Express-Reactjs-Nodejs full stack web application built using mostly pure CSS and additionally the bootstrap css framework along with font-awesome icons to demonstrate my full stack developement knowledge/skills. All of the database models, routes react components etc. are created by me from scratch, though some of them are inspired by or seen in tutorials/courses. The app is still under developement.
