# MERN ATSWIK (MERN Application to show what i know)

A Mongodb-Express-Reactjs-Nodejs full stack web application built using the bootstrap css framework along with font-awesome icons to demonstrate my full stack developement knowledge/skills. The app is still under developement.

# How to run the app

1. To run the app you need to have Node.js (preferably version 12 or more) and MongoDB installed.
2. Install server dependencies by running (inside the root directory):

```bash
	npm i
```

3. Install client dependencies by browsing the `client-app` directory and running:

```bash
	npm i
```

3. To start both the client and the server app, in the root directory run:

```bash
	npm run dev
```
